# IsoGraph agent guidance

IsoGraph is an agent-native structural knowledge representation designed to expose invariants, isomorphisms, and common structure across independently expressed domains without erasing meaningful differences.

## Authority

Before substantive work, read `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, and the semantic authority relevant to the task.

### Current qualified authority

- `CORE_SPEC_DRAFT_0_17_CONSOLIDATED_QUALIFIED.md`

Draft 0.17 is a narrow description correction over Draft 0.16. Bare IDs are **Semantic Identity (SI)** handles: representation-level referential identity used for addressing, sharing, matching, namespaces, allocation, reconstruction, and comparison. SI equality or inequality is not independently authoritative for any stronger identity relation.

### Historical authority

- `CORE_SPEC_DRAFT_0_16_CONSOLIDATED_QUALIFIED.md`
- `CORE_SPEC_DRAFT_0_15_CONSOLIDATED_CANDIDATE.md`

Draft 0.16 remains immutable historical qualification evidence for Experiment 005 and retains its obligation-sufficiency qualification. Draft 0.15 remains immutable historical qualification evidence for Experiment 004. Draft 0.17 does not retroactively reinterpret either revision.

## Research discipline

Use: assess -> research -> reassess -> plan -> execute -> qualify -> review -> cleanup/document.

Treat prior conclusions, reviews, fixtures, expected results, verifier output, and issue text as evidence rather than authority. Preserve ambiguity and residual distinctions. Do not create a new primitive, structural class, comparison relation, canonical factorization, canonical labeling requirement, or mandatory proof algorithm merely because a case is awkward or expensive.

Keep these distinctions explicit:

- surface syntax != irreducible substrate
- source-faithful representation != comparison view
- Semantic Identity (SI) != occurrence
- SI equality/inequality != independently proved stronger identity relation
- factorization != normalization
- one valid factorization != canonical factorization
- native representability != dedicated syntax
- retrieval hint != structural evidence
- source/D residual != pairwise residual
- class label != class-membership evidence
- semantic equivalence != structural isomorphism
- rule existence != rule activation
- NAC object existence != NAC evaluation
- evidence obligation != discovery algorithm
- one verified witness != complete witness family
- local factorization-node claim != factorization-space completeness
- witness equivalence in one frozen claim context != global witness equivalence

## Semantic Identity discipline

- Bare integer IDs are SI handles, not natural/ontological identity certificates.
- Same SI means the same represented referent within the applicable SI namespace.
- Different SIs remain distinct referents for core operational semantics; leaving a stronger identity question open does not make them mergeable for matching or allocation.
- Same or different SI alone supplies no stronger external identity conclusion.
- Object-theory equality remains separate from SI and does not silently coalesce SI referents.
- Freshness is SI-namespace-relative and supplies no stronger identity conclusion by itself.
- Do not import Natural Entropic Identity or other external identity semantics into core without an explicit, separately versioned dependency.

## Draft 0.16 obligation-sufficiency rules retained by Draft 0.17

A claim must discharge its complete dependency-closed obligation set. Do not require a stronger relation, stronger reconstruction layer, stronger completeness/optimality property, or unrelated qualification gate unless it is an actual dependency or explicit frozen proof-profile requirement.

Do not confuse proof sufficiency with search strategy. Qualified evidence may discharge a claim without canonicalization or exhaustive search when those are not themselves required obligations.

Do not eagerly enumerate mappings merely because multiple mappings exist. Match the witness-family coverage burden to the claim. Exact compact family descriptions require independent coverage verification.

Witness quotienting is context-scoped. No qualified context/equivalence/coverage proof means distinct verified witnesses remain distinct. A quotient valid for one downstream observation set is not globally valid.

A result at explicitly named frozen factorization/extraction nodes is local unless factorization-space coverage has been declared and exhausted or certified.

## Qualification provenance

Experiment 005 final review is `experiments/005/EXPERIMENT_005_FINAL_QUALIFICATION_REVIEW.md`.

The focused Draft 0.16 controls completed with:

```text
post-freeze scoring: 8 PASS / 0 PARTIAL / 0 FAIL / 0 UNKNOWN
independent verifier: VERIFIED
unresolved obligations: none
```

Draft 0.17 adds no separate qualification campaign because it changes the description/scope of the existing ID mechanism without changing its operational behavior.

Preserve cold-test isolation for future experiments when an actual semantic hypothesis warrants qualification: scorer assertions, expected mappings, prior decoder outputs, and author audits must remain unavailable to isolated qualification agents until their outputs are frozen.

## Qualification resource discipline

External Gemini calls and GitHub Actions executions are scarce qualification resources. Read and follow `QUALIFICATION_RESOURCE_DISCIPLINE.md` before designing or running a new qualification experiment.

Minimize external model calls and CI executions **subject to complete semantic coverage, cold isolation, reproducibility, and sufficient independent evidence**. Prefer one frozen multi-case packet, one cold semantic-decoder call, deterministic post-freeze scoring, and one independent verifier only when the qualification claim warrants it. Prefer one batched workflow/job over per-case matrices or repeated workflows when isolation does not require physical separation.

Run deterministic syntax, hash, packet-integrity, provenance, and mechanical checks before spending an external semantic call. Do not rerun Gemini or CI merely to seek a more favorable answer. Additional external calls/runs require a concrete evidentiary or infrastructure reason and should be recorded in the final qualification provenance.
