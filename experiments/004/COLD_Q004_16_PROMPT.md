Do not read assertions, results, class catalogs, registries, or prior reviews.

For this synthetic fixture the native record roles are:

```text
(^5600 SCHEMA)
(^5601 SCHEMA SLOT)
(^5602 SCHEMA SLOT ABSTRACT_REQUIRED_SUBSTRUCTURE_PATTERN)
(^5603 INSTANCE SCHEMA SLOT ASSIGNED_SUBSTRUCTURE)
```

The `^5602` abstraction is a required structural pattern over the assigned substructure; its variables are lexically owned by the nested abstractions.

## Task

1. Reconstruct schema `1601`: list parameter slots and every required pattern/constraint actually present.
2. Reconstruct schema `1602`: list parameter slots and reproduce its abstraction pattern exactly.
3. Apply the required pattern of schema `1602` to assignments `1701`, `1702`, and `1703` using the current variable-binding rules. Report a binding for matches and the structural failure reason for non-matches.
4. Evaluate the **non-vacuity/selectivity burden** separately for schemas `1601` and `1602`.
5. Do not reject `1602` merely because its assigned substructures are much larger than the fixed constraint pattern. State whether parameter size alone decides vacuity.
6. State whether this single fixture is sufficient to **promote** `1602` as a qualified reusable structural class, distinguishing non-vacuity evidence from full class qualification.

Freeze the result before consulting anything else.
